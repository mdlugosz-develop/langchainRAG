Alex: Hey! Long time no talk. How’s everything going with you? Sam: Hey! Yeah, it’s been a while. Things are good, just been super busy with work. How about you? Alex: Same here, just trying to balance work and life. You know how it is. What’ve you been up to lately? Sam: Mostly just work, but I did take a weekend trip to the mountains last week. It was amazing! The weather was perfect, and the views were unreal. Alex: That sounds awesome! Where did you go? Sam: Went up to Lake Tahoe. Have you been? Alex: Yeah, once! It’s beautiful out there. Did you do any hiking? Sam: Oh yeah, we hiked this trail called Eagle Lake. The water was so clear, and the whole area was super peaceful. I kinda didn’t want to come back to reality after that. Alex: I feel you! A little escape like that makes such a difference. I’ve been thinking of doing something similar. Work’s been draining lately. Sam: You should! Even just a couple of days can make a big difference. Do you have any place in mind? Alex: I was thinking of heading up to the coast, maybe check out Big Sur. I’ve never been but always heard great things. Sam: Oh man, Big Sur is incredible! You’re going to love it. Definitely do the Bixby Creek Bridge if you go, the views are unreal. Alex: Noted! I’ll make sure to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation. Sam: Anytime! We should plan a trip together sometime too. Alex: I’m down! Let’s make it happen. Sam: For sure! Let’s catch up more soon. Maybe grab a coffee this week? Alex: Definitely, let me know when you’re free. Sam: Will do. Talk soon! Alex: Talk soon!
