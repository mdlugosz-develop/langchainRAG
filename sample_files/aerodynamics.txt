The aerodynamics of a plane involves how air flows over its surfaces, with the wings generating lift by creating a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, while the streamlined fuselage minimizes drag; factors like angle of attack, wing shape, and airspeed are critical in maintaining efficient flight, as the plane must balance lift with weight and thrust with drag, and control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and rudders help adjust the airflow to stabilize, turn, and control altitude, allowing for smooth takeoff, flight, and landing.
